Welcome to my Profile!

I post miscellaneous projects here with no regular schedule because programming is a hobby for me. 
I usually code in Python, however, I have been branching out to other programming languages, trying to see which one fits me.
Currently, Rust and Golang are strong contenders.
I am also new to GitHub, so I might make some rookie mistakes.
